Given:
--------------
Array of variables [x0,x1,x2,x3, ...., xn-1] ,
where each xi ( i = 0,1,2,3,....(n-1) ) is normally distributed around Oy axis ( or having 0 mean/expectation )
and known but different standard deviation D0, D1, ... , Dn-1.

Problem:
--------------
Write a program to calculate the probability of the event 
x0 to occur not bigger by modulus than all the others x1,x2, ... , xn-1
